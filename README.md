# LibreEcho website

Static GitHub Pages site for **LibreEcho**, an open operating system and hardware-enablement project for Amazon Echo Gen 2.

See [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for upstream credits,
third-party licensing boundaries, the Amazon non-affiliation notice, and the
experimental-use disclaimer. The website's MIT licence applies only to the
original website source and artwork in this repository.

## Publish

1. Create an empty GitHub repository.
2. Extract this archive and copy its contents into the repository root.
3. The development repository is configured for `aslater3/LibreEcho-Docs-dev`. Update the repository and Pages URLs if you fork this project.
4. Commit and push to the `main` branch.
5. In **Settings → Pages**, select **GitHub Actions** as the source.

The included workflow publishes the site automatically on every push to `main`.

## Browser demo

The dependency-free control-centre demonstration is served from `demo/`. It uses
the production UI with a browser-local implementation of `/api/v1`, so GitHub
Pages can demonstrate settings, state transitions, JSON backup/restore and the
interactive Swagger console without running the native device daemon.

Demo settings persist in `localStorage`; the **Reset demo** control restores the
deterministic defaults. No passwords, tokens or uploaded configuration files are
sent off-device by the demo.

## Custom domain

Add a file named `CNAME` to the repository root containing only the domain, for example:

```text
libreecho.org
```

Then configure the DNS records GitHub documents for Pages. A custom domain is optional; the site works at the standard `github.io` address.

## Replacing artwork

The repository-native SVG artwork lives in `assets/images/`. It is deliberately referenced through stable filenames. To use the original generated PNG image pack later, either replace the corresponding SVG files and update the extensions in `index.html`, or export the generated images to these names:

- `echo-hero.svg` — main product image
- `open-device.svg` — contribution section artwork
- `social-card.svg` — social preview image
- `mark.svg` — project mark

## Local preview

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Project status language

The current product story is deliberately broader than hardware bring-up:
LibreEcho is now at **beta** status, retaining the Echo Gen 2 hardware while
adding working Wi-Fi, local voice processing, OpenWakeWord, Local LLM support,
AirPlay 2, streamed announcements and LED EQ visualisation. The homepage
separates working capabilities from remaining integration work such as broader
Home Assistant/Wyoming support.

The progress cards are intentionally high-level. Update their wording in
`index.html` as hardware enablement advances.
